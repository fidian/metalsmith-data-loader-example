Metalsmith Data Loader Example
==============================

This sample repository shows the different ways you can load data into pages, both from a dedicated folder (`models/` in the example) or adjacent to the file being parsed.


Usage
-----

Clone the repository. After that, install dependencies and run a build.

    $ git clone https://github.com/tests-always-included/metalsmith-data-loader-example.git
    $ cd metalsmith-data-loader-example
    $ npm install
    $ npm run build

After that, you can poke around in the `src/` and `dest/` folders to see what was used and how it turned out. The files in the `dest/` folder are just JSON-encoded forms of all of the metadata of the file.
